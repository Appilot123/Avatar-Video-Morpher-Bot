<h1 align="center">Avatar Video Morpher Bot</h1>

## Project Overview:

This project is an automation bot that dynamically morphs user-submitted photos into predefined template videos using AI-powered face tracking and video editing. The bot is designed to streamline the content personalization process — users simply pick an avatar template, upload their image, and receive a customized, shareable video with their face seamlessly integrated.

The solution automates everything from image preprocessing and facial landmark detection to deepfake-like morphing and video rendering. It’s ideal for viral marketing, digital souvenirs, and entertainment platforms looking to offer personalized video experiences at scale.


## Core Features:
- **AI-Powered Morphing:** Leverages facial recognition and deep learning to blend user faces into video avatars with natural expressions and movements.
- **Fully Automated Pipeline:** From image upload to final video generation — no manual intervention needed.
- **Cross-Platform Scalability:** Built with headless processing in mind, deployable across web, mobile, and cloud-based environments
